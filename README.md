# Audovia
Database application for making music using JFugue MusicStrings

**_[Website](https://songbase.github.io/)_**

Make music on your snapd enabled Linux laptop or PC with **Audovia**.  Songs can have up to 15 instrumental voices and a percussion track with instruments chosen from a soundbank of 128 instruments.  Either the default soundbank or one of your own can be used.  Songs can be developed, tested and edited very quickly and easily by virtue of the database structure and the JFugue MusicString notation.

Notes are specified by their name and octave or by their MIDI value and their durations are specified either by character code, or numerically.

You can use notes from C0 to G10, corresponding to MIDI values 0 to 127.  Middle C is C5.

Notes can be entered manually or by picking from graphic Treble, Alto, Tenor and Bass staves within the MusicString editor.

Within the application, use *File/Template* to create a song, then *Tree View* and expand the nodes.  Select each bar in turn and enter the notes.  Select "Song" and press *Play* to play back your music.  From the *File* menu, you can export to MIDI and WAV.  The MIDI files can be opened in LMMS for music processing or in MuseScore for music publishing.  The WAV files can be opened in Audacity, then exported to MP3.

You can share songs by exporting and importing songs in XML format.  Use *File/XML Import* to import the demonstration songs.
